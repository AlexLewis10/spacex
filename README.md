## SpaceX - In progress

A project which accesses and displays information about SpaceX rockets and dragons using their API.

### Requirements
- Fetch and render a list of rockets or dragons from SpaceX's API.
- Show extended information about a selected list item in a separate box, modal or page.

- Buttons or tabs to switch between rockets and dragons.
- A grid representation of the list.
- A single item view with an extended description (containing an image, name, etc.)

### Approach
I started by first drawing a rough diagram of how I wanted the UI to look to help me better understanding of the layout I wanted to achieve.

I then drew a diagram to get a better understanding of how my different components would fit together.

Didn't anticipate - difficulty passing array down to component.
